# Test Burndown Workflow Documentation

This document outlines the test burndown system and workflow implemented in our
codebase. The system enables automated tracking, analysis, and reporting of test
failures, helping the team systematically address and reduce test failures over
time.

## Overview

The test burndown system consists of several components that work together to
provide a comprehensive solution for managing test failures:

1. **Test Analysis Library** - Core utilities for analyzing test results
2. **Analysis Scripts** - Command-line tools for generating reports
3. **Document Generation** - Tools for creating detailed burndown documentation
4. **Historical Tracking** - Utilities for recording and analyzing trends over
   time
5. **CI Integration** - Automated workflows for continuous integration

## Components and Workflow

### 1. Test Analysis Library

Core files:

- `src/common/utils/test-burndown-analyzer.ts` - Main analyzer module
- `src/common/utils/test-burndown-history.ts` - Historical data tracking
- `src/common/utils/test-failure-consistency.ts` - Consistency analysis
- `src/common/utils/burndown-velocity.ts` - Velocity tracking and projections

These modules provide the foundation for:

- Parsing test results
- Categorizing failures by root cause
- Detecting flaky tests
- Identifying performance outliers
- Analyzing failure consistency
- Tracking burndown velocity
- Projecting completion timelines

### 2. Analysis Scripts

Primary script:

- `scripts/analyze-test-burndown.ts` - Main CLI interface

This script:

- Reads raw test results from `test-burndown.json`
- Generates analysis and reports
- Stores historical data for trend analysis
- Outputs markdown reports for human consumption

### 3. Document Generation

Primary tool:

- `tools/generate-burndown.ts` - Creates comprehensive documentation

This tool:

- Generates detailed failure analysis
- Creates formatted markdown reports
- Incorporates historical data and trends
- Maintains a living document for tracking progress

### 4. CI Integration

Configuration:

- `.github/workflows/test-burndown.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow

Support scripts:

- `scripts/compare-to-baseline.ts` - Baseline comparison mechanism
- `scripts/check-failure-threshold.ts` - CI gates for quality enforcement
- `scripts/issue-tracker-integration.ts` - Automated issue management

## Setup and Configuration

### 1. Installing Dependencies

The system requires Deno runtime. Ensure you have Deno installed:

```bash
# Check Deno version
deno --version

# If not installed, follow instructions at https://deno.land/
```

### 2. Configuring CI Workflow

The CI workflow is configured in `.github/workflows/test-burndown.yml`. Key
settings:

- **Trigger Configuration**: By default, it runs after the test matrix workflow
  completes, daily at midnight UTC, and can be manually triggered.
- **Failure Thresholds**: Set acceptable failure thresholds in
  `.burndown-config.json`.

### 3. Configuring Issue Tracker Integration

To set up issue tracker integration:

1. Create a `.burndown-tracker-config.json` file in the project root:

```json
{
  "type": "github",
  "autoCreateIssues": true,
  "autoUpdateIssues": true,
  "autoCloseIssues": true,
  "github": {
    "owner": "your-org",
    "repo": "your-repo",
    "token": "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}",
    "labels": ["test-failure", "automated", "burndown"]
  },
  "defaultAssignees": ["team-qa"]
}
```

2. Ensure appropriate permissions are set for the GitHub token in your CI
   environment.

### 4. Setting Up Baseline Tracking

The baseline mechanism helps distinguish between known and new issues:

1. Initial baseline will be created automatically on first run
2. To update baseline:

```bash
# Copy current analysis to baseline
cp test-burndown-analysis.json .burndown-baseline.json
```

## Usage Guide

### Running Analysis Locally

To run the burndown analysis locally:

```bash
# Run tests and generate test-burndown.json
deno test -A --reporter=json > test-results.json

# Run analysis script
deno run -A scripts/analyze-test-burndown.ts

# Generate full burndown document
deno run -A tools/generate-burndown.ts
```

### Manual Workflow Steps

1. **Identify Failures**: Review the generated `test-burndown-report.md`
2. **Categorize Issues**: Group by root cause and consistency
3. **Prioritize Fixes**: Focus on consistently failing tests first
4. **Implement Solutions**: Address root causes of failures
5. **Verify Fixes**: Re-run tests to ensure issues are resolved
6. **Update Baseline**: Once stable, update baseline for future comparisons

### Automated Workflow

The automated workflow follows these steps:

1. Tests are run in CI and results are captured
2. Burndown analysis generates reports and historical data
3. Baseline comparison identifies new failures
4. Issue tracker creates tickets for new failures
5. Checks against thresholds determine build success/failure
6. Reports are uploaded as artifacts
7. Optional notifications are sent for new failures

## Reports and Artifacts

The system generates several key reports:

- **test-burndown-report.md**: Main analysis report
- **test-burndown-consistency.md**: Failure consistency analysis
- **test-burndown-velocity.md**: Progress tracking and projections
- **new-test-failures.md**: Report of new failures since baseline

These reports are uploaded as artifacts in CI and can be accessed from the
GitHub Actions page.

## Monitoring and Dashboards

### Key Metrics to Monitor

The system tracks several important metrics:

1. **Pass Rate**: Percentage of passing tests
2. **Failure Consistency**: Ratio of consistent vs. intermittent failures
3. **Velocity**: Rate of test fixes over time
4. **Projected Completion**: Estimated timeline to zero failures
5. **Flakiness Score**: Measure of test reliability

### Interpretation Guide

- **Consistently Failing Tests**: Likely have a common root cause, prioritize
  fixing
- **Intermittently Failing Tests**: May indicate timing issues, race conditions,
  or environmental problems
- **Velocity Decline**: Check for increased development activity or new issues
- **Increased Flakiness**: May indicate infrastructure problems or test
  instability

## Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Run Analysis Locally**: Before submitting PRs, run analysis to catch issues
   early
2. **Add Regression Guards**: Write tests that specifically protect against
   fixed issues
3. **Document Fixes**: Update the fix history section with solutions
4. **Classify Root Causes**: Help improve categorization accuracy

### For Team Leads

1. **Regular Reviews**: Schedule periodic review of burndown progress
2. **Adjust Thresholds**: Tune failure thresholds based on project phase
3. **Assign Ownership**: Ensure test failures have clear owners
4. **Track Velocity**: Monitor fix rate to allocate resources appropriately

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing historical data**: Create `.burndown-history` directory if it
   doesn't exist
2. **CI workflow failures**: Check GitHub Actions logs for specific error
   messages
3. **Issue tracker integration problems**: Verify token permissions and
   configuration

### Getting Help

For further assistance:

1. Check the source code comments for detailed explanations
2. Refer to the test burndown analyzer code for implementation details
3. Update this documentation as the system evolves

## Further Development

Potential enhancements for the future:

1. **Integration with more issue trackers**: JIRA, Linear, etc.
2. **Enhanced visualization dashboard**: Interactive charts and graphs
3. **Machine learning-based flakiness detection**: Automated pattern recognition
4. **Extended test ownership mapping**: Integration with CODEOWNERS
5. **Test stability scoring**: Rating system for test reliability
