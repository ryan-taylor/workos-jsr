# WorkOS Deno Port Release Preparation

This document summarizes the preparation steps completed for releasing version
1.0.0 of the WorkOS Deno port to JSR.io.

## 1. Test Verification

All critical tests have been executed with the proper permission flags, and have
passed successfully:

- Core utility tests pass without issues
- Feature-specific module tests (Portal, etc.) pass
- CodeGen tests pass with appropriate permissions

A detailed test result summary can be found in
[docs/test-results-summary.md](./test-results-summary.md).

## 2. Version Updates

The following files have been updated to reflect the 1.0.0 release:

- `deno.json`: Version updated from 0.1.0 to 1.0.0
- `jsr.json`: Already set to version 1.0.0
- `CHANGELOG.md`: Enhanced with details about test permission fixes

## 3. CHANGELOG Updates

The CHANGELOG.md has been updated to include information about:

- Fixed test permission issues requiring multiple flags
- Implementation of fallback mechanisms for tests with restricted permissions
- Previously documented fixes for type compatibility issues
- Previously documented module fixes and lint issues

## 4. Publishing Preparation

The JSR.io configuration in `jsr.json` is complete and ready for publishing,
including:

- Proper metadata (name, version, description)
- Appropriate file inclusion/exclusion patterns
- Required dependencies

## 5. Next Steps

To complete the release, follow the instructions in
[docs/publishing.md](./publishing.md) to:

1. Publish to JSR.io
2. Create the GitHub release with appropriate tagging

## 6. Remaining Considerations

- Some codegen tests require multiple permission flags (read, write, env, sys,
  run)
- The dependency on Node.js compatibility layers introduces additional
  permission requirements
- Future work may include reducing permission requirements through mocking
