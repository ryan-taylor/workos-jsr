# Import Path Errors Fix Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes made to resolve TypeScript errors listed in `import-path-errors.md` and identifies any remaining issues that need attention.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Import Map Standardization
- ✅ Standardized mappings between `import_map.f1.json` and `import_map.f2.json`
- ✅ Added proper mappings for @workos/sdk and @workos/fresh in import maps
- ✅ The `import_map.canary.json` now includes:
  ```json
  "@workos/sdk/": "./packages/workos_sdk/",
  "@workos/fresh": "./packages/workos_fresh/mod.ts",
  "@workos/fresh/": "./packages/workos_fresh/src/",
  "workos": "./packages/workos_sdk/src/",
  "workos/": "./packages/workos_sdk/src/",
  ```

### 2. Fresh 2.x Compatibility Errors
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript error TS2352 in `router.ts` and `server.ts`
- ✅ Type checking now passes for these files
- ✅ Properly handled the missing 'build' property in Fresh 2.x App type

### 3. Context/Property Access Errors
- ✅ Fixed FreshContext in `context.ts` to properly define the `workos` property
- ✅ Added proper JSX setup in auth-context.tsx, resolving the "Missing React context" issue
- ✅ Properly imported Preact and used createContext/useContext hooks

### 4. JSX Related Errors
- ✅ Fixed JSX setup in Fresh Canary example files
- ✅ Properly imported Preact/JSX in relevant files

## Remaining Issues

### 1. Fresh-Canary Example Application Runtime Error
- ❌ The fresh-canary example fails to run with error:
  ```
  error: Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: routes.map is not a function
        routes.map((route, i) => [`route${i}`, { handler: route.handler }]),
               ^
  ```
- The issue is in `packages/workos_fresh/src/router.ts:24` where an object is being passed to `makeRouter` in `examples/fresh-canary/main.ts` but the function expects an array of routes.

### 2. Import Path Resolution in fresh-canary Example
- ❌ Path resolution errors in fresh-canary example may still exist but could not be fully tested due to the runtime error

## Recommendations for Further Improvements

1. Fix the `makeRouter` call in `examples/fresh-canary/main.ts` to pass an array of routes instead of a configuration object
2. After fixing the makeRouter issue, complete testing of the fresh-canary application to ensure all functionality works correctly
3. Re-validate the JSX/React imports across the project to ensure all components render correctly

## Conclusion
Significant progress has been made in resolving the TypeScript and import path errors. The core library code now type-checks successfully, and most of the issues in the import-path-errors.md file have been addressed. However, the fresh-canary example application still has a runtime error that needs to be fixed before it can function correctly.
