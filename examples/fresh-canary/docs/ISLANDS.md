# Islands Architecture in Fresh + Preact

The Islands Architecture is a modern approach to web development that combines the best of both server-rendered static content and client-side interactivity. This document explains the concept and provides details on the islands implemented in this example application.

## What is Islands Architecture?

Islands Architecture is a term coined by Jason Miller (creator of Preact) that describes a web page as a static, server-rendered HTML document with "islands" of interactivity that are selectively hydrated on the client.

### Key Concepts

1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: The entire page is initially rendered on the server as HTML
2. **Selective Hydration**: Only interactive components ("islands") are hydrated with JavaScript on the client
3. **Minimal JavaScript**: Most of the page remains as static HTML, reducing JavaScript payload
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: The page works without JavaScript, with interactivity added as an enhancement

### Benefits

- **Performance**: Faster page loads with minimal JavaScript
- **SEO**: Better search engine optimization due to server rendering
- **Accessibility**: Core functionality works without JavaScript
- **Developer Experience**: Clear separation between static and interactive components

## Islands vs. Traditional React Applications

| Feature | Traditional React App | Islands Architecture |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Initial Render | Client-side (CSR) or sometimes SSR with full hydration | Server-side (SSR) |
| JavaScript Load | Entire application bundle | Only what's needed for interactive parts |
| Hydration | Full-page hydration | Selective component hydration |
| State Management | App-wide state often required | Isolated state per island |
| Build Process | Complex bundling | Minimal or no bundling |
| Progressive Enhancement | Harder to implement | Built-in by design |

## Islands in Fresh

In Fresh, islands are defined as separate Preact components in the `islands/` directory. These components:

1. Are automatically detected by Fresh
2. Receive props from the server during initial render
3. Are hydrated on the client, making them interactive
4. Can maintain their own state independent of other islands

The rest of your application (routes, components outside the `islands/` directory) is rendered on the server and sent as static HTML to the client.

    - Purpose: Demonstrates how hydration works in Fresh
    - Features: Visual indicators of hydration status
    - Usage: Used on the documentation page

11. **StylesDemo**
    - Purpose: Showcases styling approaches with Fresh/Preact
    - Features: Different styling methods (CSS, CSS Modules, etc.)
    - Usage: Used on the documentation page

## When to Use Islands vs. Static Components

### Use Islands When:

- **User Input is Required**: Forms, search boxes, filters
- **Interactive Elements**: Dropdowns, tabs, accordions, sliders
- **Dynamic Updates**: Data that changes without page refresh
- **Client-Side State**: Components that maintain state between interactions
- **Animations**: Complex animations that require JavaScript

### Use Static (Server) Components When:

- **Content Display**: Blog posts, articles, documentation
- **Navigation**: Headers, footers, navigation menus
- **Static Layouts**: Page structure, grids, containers
- **SEO-Critical Content**: Content that needs to be indexed by search engines
- **Performance-Critical Pages**: Landing pages, high-traffic pages

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Islands Small**: Each island adds to the JavaScript payload
2. **Limit State Sharing**: Islands should be self-contained when possible
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Ensure basic functionality works without JavaScript
4. **Lazy Loading**: Consider lazy-loading islands that aren't immediately visible
5. **Hydration Timing**: Use appropriate hydration timing (immediate vs. idle vs. visible)

## Example Usage

Here's how to use an island in a route file:

```tsx
// routes/profile.tsx
import { Handlers, PageProps } from "$fresh/server.ts";
import UserProfile from "../islands/UserProfile.tsx";
import { getCurrentUser } from "../utils/user-management.ts";

export const handler: Handlers = {
  async GET(req, ctx) {
    const user = await getCurrentUser(req);
    if (!user) {
      return new Response("", {
        status: 302,
        headers: { Location: "/login" },
      });
    }
    
    return ctx.render({ user });
  },
};

export default function ProfilePage({ data }: PageProps) {
  const { user } = data;
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Profile</h1>
      {/* UserProfile will be hydrated on the client */}
      <UserProfile user={user} />
      
      {/* This content remains static */}
      <div class="static-content">
        <h2>Account Options</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="/settings">Settings</a></li>
          <li><a href="/logout">Logout</a></li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Debugging Islands

- Islands are marked with HTML comments in the server output
- You can inspect network requests to see which island chunks are loaded
- Use the Fresh dev tools overlay to visualize islands and their boundaries
