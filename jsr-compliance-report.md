# JSR Compliance Verification Report

## Issues Found and Fixed

1. **Fixed Telemetry Type Mismatch**
   - The `initTelemetry` function in
     `packages/workos_sdk/src/telemetry/workos-integration.ts` had incompatible
     parameter types
   - Updated the function to accept optional partial configuration and use
     proper default values

2. **Updated JSR Configuration**
   - Modified `jsr.json` to explicitly exclude script directories containing
     npm: imports
   - Added exclusions for `.deno_codegen_cache` directory

## Remaining Issues

1. **Deno Publish Command Crash**
   - The `deno publish --dry-run` command crashes with a panic related to
     overlapping text changes
   - This appears to be a bug in Deno's publishing system when processing
     postcss imports
   - Error message: "Text changes were overlapping. Past index was 283, but new
     change had index 276"

2. **NPM Imports in Script Files**
   - Some script files in the `scripts/codegen` directory contain npm: imports
   - These have been excluded from JSR publishing via the jsr.json configuration

## Verification Steps Performed

1. ✅ Fixed type compatibility issue in telemetry initialization
2. ✅ Ran `deno lint` to check for linting issues (found pre-existing issues not
   directly related to JSR publishing)
3. ✅ Ran `deno doc` to verify documentation generation (completed successfully)
4. ❌ Attempted `deno publish --dry-run` to verify JSR compliance (crashed due
   to Deno bug)
5. ✅ Checked for npm: specifiers using `scripts/check-no-npm-imports.ts`
6. ✅ Verified all files compile without --unstable flag using
   `deno check mod.ts`
7. ✅ Updated jsr.json file to properly exclude directories with npm: imports

## Recommendations

1. **Fix for Deno Panic Issue**
   - This appears to be a bug in Deno itself rather than an issue with your code
   - Consider reporting this issue to the Deno team with the error details
   - As a workaround, you might try using a different version of Deno for
     publishing

2. **JSR Configuration**
   - The current jsr.json configuration appears correct with:
     - Proper name, version, and exports fields
     - Appropriate files list for publication
     - Exclusion of test files and directories with npm: imports

3. **Next Steps**
   - After the Deno panic issue is resolved, run the publish dry-run again to
     verify JSR compliance
   - Consider updating any remaining esm.sh imports to JSR equivalents where
     possible
