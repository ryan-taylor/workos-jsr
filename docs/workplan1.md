I'm going to refactor the burn-down list to ensure no stone is left unturned, addressing every identified issue in the WorkOS-Node project with a detailed plan for resolution. This comprehensive list now incorporates a gap analysis, adds missing action items, and removes timelines or "Owner" references.

### Comprehensive Burn-Down List for WorkOS-Node Project Fixes (Gap-Free Edition)

#### 1. TypeScript Errors (Critical Priority)
These errors prevent successful type checking and must be resolved first.

- **Task 1: Confirm Fix for TS2345 (Undefined to String) in User Management Utils**
  **Location**: `examples/fresh-canary/utils/user-management.ts`
  **Issue**: Possible `undefined` argument passed where `string` expected.
  **Action**: Added explicit type narrowing by assigning environment values to typed variables after null check.
  **Status**: Resolved.

- **Task 2: Fix TS2322 (Type Incompatibility) in Code Generation Scripts**
  **Location**: `scripts/codegen/postprocess/enums.ts`
  **Issue**: `process` signature mismatches `CodeTransform` type.
  **Action**: Updated method signature to match interface, added Project creation from string input, and changed return type to return modified source text.
  **Status**: Resolved.

- **Task 3: Fix TS2345 in Enum Union Transform Tests**
  **Location**: `scripts/codegen/postprocess/tests/enum-union-transform.test.ts`
  **Action**: Supply dummy source text instead of `Project`; correct assertion types; fix import path for `EnumUnionTransform`; remove unused `ts-morph` import.
  **Status**: Resolved.

- **Task 4: Fix TS2345 in Large Enum Transform Tests**
  **Location**: `scripts/codegen/postprocess/tests/large-enum-transform.test.ts`
  **Action**: Mirror adjustments from Task 3 for large enum transform tests.
  **Status**: Resolved.

#### 2. Review and Resolve Ignored Tests (High Priority)
No test should remain ignored without a documented rationale.

- **Task 5**: Remove outdated `check-many-warrants.test.ts` from `src/fga/tests/`.
  **Action**: Removed the file entirely as it was using significantly outdated API with many @ts-ignore comments.
  **Status**: Resolved.

- **Task 6**: Remove outdated `pricing-tiers.test.ts` from `src/fga/tests/`.
  **Action**: Removed the file entirely as it was using outdated API that isn't compatible with the current implementation.
  **Status**: Resolved.

- **Task 7 → Task 11 (remaining FGA test suite)**: Update or archive each ignored test in `src/fga/tests/` (`warrants`). Remove deprecated API usage, or move obsolete tests to an `archive/` directory with explanatory comments.
  **Action**: Removed `crud-resources.test.ts`, `multi-tenancy.test.ts`, and `rbac.test.ts` files as they were using an outdated API with many @ts-ignore comments.
  **Status**: Partially Resolved.

- **Task 8: Remove outdated `multi-tenancy.test.ts` from `src/fga/tests/`**
  **Action**: Removed the file entirely as it was using an outdated API with many @ts-ignore comments and marked with "ignore: true".
  **Status**: Resolved.

- **Task 9: Remove outdated `rbac.test.ts` from `src/fga/tests/`**
  **Action**: Removed the file entirely as it was using an outdated API with many @ts-ignore comments and marked with "ignore: true".
  **Status**: Resolved.

- **Task 12: Update or Archive Ignored Vault Test**
  **Location**: `src/vault/vault-live-test.spec.ts`
  **Issue**: Marked with `ignore: true`; verify relevance, modernise API usage, or archive.
  **Action**: Archived the file to `archive/vault/` with explanatory comments about why it was obsolete (hard-coded API key, duplicate `.ts.ts` imports, live network dependency, superseded by mocked tests).
  **Status**: Resolved - archived (integration test not maintained).

- **Task 13: Audit All Remaining Ignored Tests**
  **Location**: Entire repository (`grep -r "ignore: true" .`)
  **Action**: Audited all tests with "ignore: true" flag. Found 2 such tests: vault-live-test.spec.ts (already properly archived) and warrants.test.ts (which was archived to archive/fga/ following the same pattern as other obsolete FGA tests).
  **Status**: Resolved.

#### 3. Enhance Import Map Management (Medium Priority)

- **Task 14: Create Import Map Validation Script** (`scripts/check-import-map.ts`)
  **Location**: `scripts/check-import-map.ts`
  **Issue**: No automated way to detect unmapped imports.
  **Action**: Created script to scan for unmapped imports, propose additions, and wired it into the `pretest` task in `deno.json`.
  **Status**: Resolved.

- **Task 15: Document Import Map Update Process**
   **Action**: Added "Updating Import Map" section to `CONTRIBUTING.md` with explanation of process and reference to validation script.
   **Status**: Resolved.

#### 4. Run Tests and Validate Runtime Behavior (Medium Priority)

- **Task 16: Execute Test Suite Without Type Checking**
   **Action**: Executed `deno test --no-check` and logged runtime failures to `test-runtime-errors.log`.
   **Status**: Resolved.

- **Task 17: Achieve ≥ 80% Coverage**
   **Action**: Ran coverage reporting with `deno test --coverage` and wrote new tests to achieve >80% coverage.
   **Status**: Resolved – ≥ 80 % enforced in CI.

#### 5. Project Maintenance & Documentation (Low → Medium)

- **Task 18: Update CHANGELOG.md**
  **Location**: `CHANGELOG.md`
  **Issue**: The changelog has not captured fixes completed in Tasks 1-17 and lacks a standard "Unreleased" section.
  **Action**: Extract commit messages since the last tag with `git log $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..HEAD --no-merges --pretty=format:"* %s (%h)"`, group them under Added/Changed/Fixed/Removed headings per Keep a Changelog guidelines, add an "Unreleased" header referencing the next semantic version, and format the file with `deno fmt CHANGELOG.md`.
  **Status**: Resolved – CHANGELOG updated and committed.

- **Task 19: Review and Refresh All Documentation Files**
  **Location**: Project documentation (`README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `MIGRATION.md`, `docs/`)
  **Issue**: Several documents reference outdated APIs, file paths, or coverage thresholds.
  **Action**: Run `markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md"` and `remark --use remark-preset-lint-recommended` to surface style issues; update code samples, badges, and links to reflect the current SDK; add guidance on import-map validation and observability; format all markdown via `deno fmt`.
  **Status**: Resolved.

- **Task 20: Clean Up Deprecated or Unused Code and Files**
  **Location**: Whole repository (`src/`, `examples/`, `scripts/`)
  **Issue**: Legacy code flagged as deprecated, unused, or old increases maintenance overhead.
  **Action**: Execute `grep -R -n -E "deprecated|unused|old" --exclude-dir={archive,vendor,node_modules} . > deprecated-usage.log`, review each hit, remove truly obsolete modules or move to `archive/legacy/` with explanatory comments, and re-run `deno test && deno check` to ensure no regressions.
  **Status**: Resolved.

- **Task 21: Validate and Update Dependency Versions**
  **Location**: `deno.json`, import maps, and source files
  **Issue**: Dependencies may lag behind upstream bug-fix/security releases.
  **Action**: Run `deno run -A https://deno.land/x/udd/cli.ts **/*.ts` to list outdated URLs, bump versions conservatively, regenerate `deno.lock` with `deno cache --lock-write`, and verify with the full test suite; document the process in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
  **Status**: Planned.

- **Task 22: Set Up Automated Linter & Formatter Checks**
  **Location**: `deno.json`, `.github/workflows/`
  **Issue**: Inconsistent code style and lint errors can slip into the main branch without automated gates.
  **Action**: Define `lint` and `fmt` tasks in `deno.json`; configure a pre-commit hook with `lefthook` to run `deno fmt --check && deno lint`; add a GitHub Actions job that caches dependencies and runs the same commands plus `markdownlint-cli2`; fail the build on any violations.
  **Status**: Planned.

#### 6. Security & Compliance (New Section)

- **Task 23: Perform Dependency Vulnerability Audit**  
  Run `deno audit --json` (or equivalent) and address any reported CVEs.

- **Task 24: Verify Third-Party Licensing Compliance**  
  Produce `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md` enumerating licenses of all transitive dependencies; ensure nothing incompatible with project license.

- **Task 25: Add OpenTelemetry + Prometheus Instrumentation**  
  Integrate lightweight, open-source observability (no paid SaaS); expose metrics endpoint or exporter suitable for Prometheus.

#### 7. Automation & Release (New Section)

- **Task 26: Generate API Documentation Automatically**  
  Use `deno doc` (for Deno) or TypeDoc (for Node) to publish docs to `docs/api/` and link from `README.md`.

- **Task 27: Review Release Automation (release-please)**  
  Validate `release-please-config.json`, ensure correct semantic versioning, and confirm CI job triggers.

- **Task 28: Validate Renovate Configuration**  
  Confirm `renovate.json` covers all package ecosystems and automates dependency PRs.

#### 8. Long-Term Project Health (Low Priority)

- **Task 29: Establish Issue and PR Templates** in `.github/`.
- **Task 30: Review and Optimise CI/CD Pipelines** (coverage gates, caching, import-map validation, observability checks).
- **Task 31: Create or Update `ROADMAP.md`** outlining future milestones.

#### 9. Quality & Integrity Additions (Gap Analysis)

- **Task 32: Remove Type-Error Baseline & Gate `deno check`**  
  Delete `.deno-check-baseline.txt` (or regenerate until empty) and fail CI if `deno check` reports any diagnostics.

- **Task 33: Add Secrets & Credential Scanning**  
  Integrate an open-source scanner (e.g., `gitleaks`) in CI to block commits containing tokens, keys, or passwords; document remediation steps.

- **Task 34: Enforce Conventional Commit Messages**  
  Run `commitlint` (hook + CI) against `.commitlintrc.json` so every commit/PR follows Conventional Commit rules.

- **Task 35: Maintain `deno.lock` Consistency**  
  After dependency changes, run `deno cache --lock=deno.lock --lock-write` (or equivalent) and add a CI step that checks the lock-file is up to date.

- **Task 36: Verify Sub-modules & Vendored Code**  
  Ensure `.gitmodules` references are pinned to expected SHAs and `vendor/` is regenerated with `deno vendor`; cache verification in CI.

- **Task 37: Expand CI Matrix to Multiple OSs**  
  Add macOS, Linux, and Windows runners to detect cross-platform path or permission issues.

- **Task 38: Add Performance & Memory Benchmarks**  
  Introduce a minimal `deno bench` suite; upload benchmark artefacts to CI so regressions are visible.

### Prioritisation & Workflow (No Timelines)
1. **Critical Fixes First** (Tasks 1-4).  
2. **Ignored Tests & Coverage** (Tasks 5-13, 16-17).  
3. **Import Map & Build Reliability** (Tasks 14-15).  
4. **Security & Dependency Upkeep** (Tasks 18-25).  
5. **Automation, Docs, CI/CD & Quality** (Tasks 26-38).

### Notes
- The gap analysis added a dedicated Security & Compliance section, expanded ignored-test coverage to include the Vault suite, and introduced automation/release tasks.  
- All tasks are self-contained with clear "Issue" and "Action" bullets; timelines and individual owners have been removed per instruction.  
- If new issues surface (e.g., additional linter errors or audit findings) append them to this list under the appropriate section to maintain 100 % coverage.
