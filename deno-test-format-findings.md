# Deno Test Format Verification

## Summary

The following test files have been verified to already use the native Deno.test format:

- tests/audit_logs.test.ts
- tests/core.test.ts
- tests/directory_sync.test.ts
- tests/http_client.test.ts
- tests/http_client_complete.test.ts
- tests/mfa.test.ts
- tests/organizations.test.ts
- tests/passwordless_complete.test.ts
- tests/passwordless.test.ts
- tests/path_operations.test.ts (uses t.step approach)
- tests/sso.test.ts

## Details

All files use:

- Direct `Deno.test()` functions (not describe/it nesting)
- Assertions from @std/assert
- Clear, descriptive test names
- Flat test organization

No conversion is needed for these files as they already follow the established Deno.test conversion approach:

- Imports assertions from @std/assert
- Uses flat Deno.test functions with descriptive names
- Does not use beforeEach/afterEach hooks
- Uses Deno's standard assertion library
