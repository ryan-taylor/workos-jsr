# Type Safety Improvements PR

## Overview

This PR represents the culmination of our type safety refactoring project across
multiple phases. We've enhanced the codebase by replacing `any` types with
proper interfaces and types, adding runtime type guards, and improving
documentation. These changes make the codebase more maintainable, provide better
IDE support, and catch potential type-related bugs at compile time.

## Changes by Phase

### Phase 1: Enhanced Test Type Definitions

- Replaced `any` with concrete types in test files
- Improved test fixtures with proper typing
- Enhanced mock objects with appropriate interfaces

### Phase 2: Added JWT and Crypto Type Definitions

- Created `JWTHeader` and `JWTPayload` interfaces for crypto modules
- Added strong typing for JWT operations
- Implemented proper error types for cryptographic operations
- Added compile-time type tests to ensure type safety

### Phase 3: Added Signature and Timestamp Types

- Created `SignaturePayload` type for webhook verification
- Added `TimestampValue` type for consistent timestamp handling
- Enhanced error handling for signature verification
- Improved typing for crypto provider interfaces

### Phase 4: Metadata Value and Map Types

- Implemented `MetadataValue` type to properly constrain allowed metadata values
- Created `MetadataMap` interface with proper key-value typing
- Added runtime type guards to validate metadata at runtime
- Updated serializers to use the new metadata types
- Updated documentation to reflect these changes

## New Types Added

### MetadataMap

```typescript
export interface MetadataMap {
  [key: string]: MetadataValue;
}

export type MetadataValue =
  | string
  | number
  | boolean
  | null
  | MetadataValue[]
  | { [key: string]: MetadataValue };
```

This type ensures that metadata can only contain valid JSON-serializable values
and provides proper typing for nested objects.

### JWTHeader and JWTPayload

```typescript
export interface JWTHeader {
  alg: string;
  typ?: string;
  kid?: string;
  [key: string]: any; // Allow additional properties
}

export interface JWTPayload {
  iss?: string;
  sub?: string;
  aud?: string | string[];
  exp?: number;
  nbf?: number;
  iat?: number;
  jti?: string;
  [key: string]: any; // Allow additional properties
}
```

These interfaces provide proper typing for JWT operations while maintaining
flexibility for custom claims.

### SignaturePayload

```typescript
export type SignaturePayload =
  | string
  | Record<string, unknown>
  | unknown[];
```

This type properly constrains the types of data that can be signed, improving
type safety in webhook verification.

## Important Considerations for Reviewers

1. **Backward Compatibility**: All changes maintain backward compatibility with
   existing code.
2. **Runtime Type Guards**: We've added runtime type guards for metadata
   validation to catch type errors at runtime.
3. **Test Coverage**: All new types have associated tests to verify their
   behavior.
4. **Documentation**: Documentation has been updated to reflect the new types.

## Testing Evidence

- All tests pass with the new type definitions
- Formatter and linter were run to ensure code quality
- Type-checking has been verified on all modified files

This PR completes our type safety improvement initiative and provides a solid
foundation for future development.
