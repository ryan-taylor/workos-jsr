# Deno 2.x Type Check Report

## Summary
This report documents the findings from running `deno check` on the codebase after the Deno 2.x + Fresh 2.x migration. The core SDK module (`mod.ts`) has been fixed, but there are remaining issues in the Fresh application.

## Fixed Issues

1. **Fixed module path resolution issue in core SDK**:
   - Incorrect import path in `directory-sync.ts` was referencing a non-existent module path:
   ```typescript
   import { DirectorySyncService, setWorkOSInstance } from "workos/generated/2025-05-12/index.ts";
   ```
   - Fixed by creating the missing file and updating the import path to use relative imports:
   ```typescript
   import { DirectorySyncService, setWorkOSInstance } from "../../generated/2025-05-12/index.ts";
   ```

2. **Added missing `index.ts` module**:
   - Created `packages/workos_sdk/generated/2025-05-12/index.ts` to re-export the necessary components.
   - This file now provides the `DirectorySyncService` and utility functions needed by the SDK.

## Remaining Issues

1. **JSX Type Issues in Fresh 2.x Application**:
   - JSX element typing errors in Fresh application components
   - Added JSX declaration file and compiler options, but more configuration is needed

2. **Missing Module Issues**:
   - `src/common/interfaces/event.interface.ts`
   - `src/common/crypto/deno-crypto-provider.ts`

3. **API Compatibility Issues**:
   - Several methods are missing or have changed signatures in the Deno 2.x API:
     - `auditLogs.createExport`
     - `auditLogs.getExport`
     - `widgets.getToken`
   - Type compatibility issues in FGA module and other services

## Next Steps

1. **Address Fresh 2.x JSX Configuration**:
   - Properly configure the Fresh 2.x application to use the JSX types

2. **Update Utility Modules**:
   - Fix imports in utility files to reference the correct locations after the migration

3. **API Compatibility Updates**:
   - Update code that uses changed/removed methods to match the Deno 2.x API surface

## Conclusion

The core SDK now successfully passes type checking with Deno 2.x, but additional work is needed to fully migrate the Fresh application. The changes made so far provide a solid foundation for continuing the migration process.
