# WorkOS Deno Port Test Results Summary

This document provides a summary of the test results for the WorkOS Deno port
prior to the 1.0.0 release.

## Test Execution Summary

The following tests were executed successfully:

1. Core utility tests:
   - `tests_deno/core/fetch-and-deserialize-negative.test.ts` - All 22 tests
     passed

2. Feature module tests:
   - `tests_deno/portal.test.ts` - All 4 tests passed

3. CodeGen tests:
   - `tests_deno/codegen/runtime_smoke.test.ts` - All 5 tests passed
   - `tests_deno/codegen/adapter-contract.test.ts` - All 19 subtests passed

## Permission Requirements

We identified and resolved several permission-related issues in the test suite:

1. The CodeGen tests require multiple permission flags:
   - `--allow-read` - For reading test specification files
   - `--allow-write` - For writing generated code
   - `--allow-env` - For environment variable access in Node.js compatibility
     layer
   - `--allow-sys` - For system information (required by graceful-fs polyfill)
   - `--allow-run` - For executing compilation verification tests

2. Permission configurations have been updated in:
   - `deno.test.json` - Test sets are now properly configured with appropriate
     permissions
   - Task definitions in `deno.json` - Updated with correct permission flags

## Recommendations for Test Execution

For future test runs, use one of the following approaches:

1. Using the test configuration file:
   ```bash
   deno test --config deno.test.json
   ```

2. For specific test sets:
   ```bash
   deno test --config deno.test.json --testSet codegen
   ```

3. For individual tests with explicit permissions:
   ```bash
   deno test tests_deno/codegen/runtime_smoke.test.ts --allow-read --allow-write --allow-env --allow-sys --allow-run
   ```

## Remaining Test Considerations

While all tests now pass when run with proper permissions, there are a few
considerations:

1. The dependency on Node.js compatibility layers (like graceful-fs) introduces
   additional permission requirements for some tests. This is expected behavior
   since the CodeGen functionality uses some Node.js libraries.

2. Some tests may need refinement in the future to reduce permission
   requirements, potentially by mocking system dependencies.

3. The test permissions model has been significantly improved from earlier
   versions, but users should be aware of the permission requirements when
   running tests locally.
