# Type Safety Refactoring: Summary of Changes

## Overview

We have completed a comprehensive effort to eliminate `any` usage across the WorkOS SDK codebase, replacing it with either `unknown` or concrete types. This effort significantly improves the type safety and developer experience when using the SDK.

## Changes Made

### Core SDK Modules

1. **User Management Module**
   - Replaced test interface `any` with proper concrete types
   - Updated JWT verification test code to use correct types instead of type assertions

2. **Webhooks Module**
   - Improved test variables with more specific types

3. **Actions Module**
   - Replaced type assertions with proper interfaces for accessing properties in tests

4. **Common Module**
   - Strengthened types in HTTP client and networking code
   - Some `any` types remain in crypto/JWT-related functionality due to inherent dynamic nature

5. **FGA Module**
   - Majority of remaining `any` types are in this module due to API design that handles arbitrary metadata

### Test Utilities

- Updated test utility interfaces to use more specific types where possible
- Some `any` usage remains in test mocking code where dynamic behavior is required

### Examples and Fresh Routes

- Improved types in Fresh Canary example where possible
- Some `any` usage remains in routes that handle generic session data

## Remaining `any` Usage

We've documented the remaining `any` usage in `remaining-any-types.md`. These instances fall into a few categories:

1. **API Requirements**: Some APIs genuinely need to handle arbitrary data
2. **Dynamic Behavior**: Certain modules (particularly FGA and JWT-related code) deal with unpredictable data structures
3. **Examples/Tests**: Some example code and test utilities retain `any` for flexibility

## Improvements and Benefits

1. **Type Safety**: The codebase is now significantly more type-safe, reducing potential runtime errors
2. **Developer Experience**: Better autocomplete and type checking for SDK users
3. **Code Quality**: More explicit typing reveals intent and improves code readability
4. **Maintenance**: Easier to maintain and refactor with stronger type guarantees

## Follow-up Work

Future improvements could include:

1. Module-specific cleanup for FGA, which has the most remaining `any` usages
2. Creating more specific schema types for metadata and context fields
3. Replacing some `any` with `Record<string, string | number | boolean | object>` where appropriate
4. Addressing `any` usage in example code and test utilities
